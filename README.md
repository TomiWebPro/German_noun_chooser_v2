Get_new_words 🆕

Discover them conveniently in both the new_words.txt and new_words.json formats. The choice is yours, and the opportunities to grow are endless.

Update_the_memorized.py 🧠
Once you feel confident that you've absorbed the new words, it's time to make them a permanent part of your repertoire. The Update_the_memorized.py script takes the words from new_words.txt and adds them to learned_words.txt. Your progress is preserved, and you can always revisit your learned words for a quick refresher.

Manually_find_add_words.py ✍️
We understand that language learning is personal. The Manually_find_add_words.py script empowers you to add words you already know to learned_words.txt. Your vocab journey is uniquely yours, and this feature ensures your accomplishments are accurately reflected.

JSON Format for Power and Precision
Behind the scenes, all our .txt files have a counterpart in the powerful JSON format. This allows your computer to seamlessly interact with the data, making operations smoother and more efficient. While you can explore the contents, it's recommended not to edit these files unless you're familiar with the structure.
